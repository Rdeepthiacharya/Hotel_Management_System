# Project Description
This website lets users easily book hotel rooms by selecting their preferred dates and room types. They can browse room photos, explore additional facilities available, and make well-informed decisions.

The application's backend handles user authentication, hotel information, room availability, and booking transactions using FastAPI endpoints that interact with an SQLite database. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their bookings through the website.

The front-end interface enables users to navigate the website seamlessly, search for rooms and facilities, view available accommodations, and book their desired stay.

Overall, this website provides a convenient platform for users to find and book accommodations for their travel needs.
